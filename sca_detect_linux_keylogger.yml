    title: "PAM abuse to log keystrokes"
    description: "Threat actors may enable the PAM auditing feature to log keystrokes."
    rationale: "By adding the line 'pam_tty_audit.so enable=' to the PAM configuration files, the system is configured to require the pam_tty_audit.so module to log TTY sessions."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth files, to disable the PAM TTY auditing feature."

    title: "PAM abuse to log passwords"
    description: "Threat actors may enable the PAM auditing feature to log password."
    rationale: "By a line similar to 'pam_tty_audit.so enable=* log_password' to the PAM configuration files, the system is configured to require the pam_tty_audit.so module to log passwords in TTY sessions."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth files, to disable the PAM TTY password auditing feature."

    description: "Threat actors may log shell history to a file they can easily read from, most commonly a log file."
    rationale: "Threat actors utilize shell prompts such as the PROMPT_COMMAND variable, the precmd() function or some other shell feature to log every command executed."
    remediation: "Edit your shell configuration files, and remove configuration lines that attempt to write shell history to another file different from the default shell history file."
